# 📌 Bias and Variance in Machine Learning

This repository contains a presentation on **Bias and Variance**, the fundamental concepts at the heart of machine learning model evaluation and performance.

## 📖 Overview
Machine Learning models often face two major sources of error: **Bias** and **Variance**.  
Understanding and balancing these is essential for building accurate and generalizable models.

### 🔑 Key Topics Covered
- **Bias**: Error due to oversimplification of the model (underfitting).  
- **Variance**: Error due to over-complexity and sensitivity to training data noise (overfitting).  
- **Different Scenarios**:
  - High Bias, Low Variance (Underfitting)  
  - Low Bias, High Variance (Overfitting)  
  - High Bias, High Variance (Worst Case)  
  - Low Bias, Low Variance (Ideal Case)  

### 🎯 Goal
To explain how Bias and Variance influence model accuracy, and how achieving the right balance helps improve performance on unseen data.

## 📂 Contents
- `BIAS AND VARIANCE.pdf` – The main presentation file.

## 🚀 Use Case
- For students and professionals learning **model evaluation**.
- As teaching material in **data science & machine learning courses**.
- For quick revision on the **bias-variance tradeoff** concept.
